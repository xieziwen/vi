Put the name and formula of vegetation index to be calculated in the "index" and "formula" columns of "vi_fun_rgb.csv" respectively.
Put the images that need to calculate vegetation index into the "Rdata" path according to different folders, and note that there is only one directory.

Calculate the vegetation index of RGB images, and express the three bands with "R, G and B" under "vi_fun_rgb.csv".
The vegetation index of multispectral images is calculated, and the bands are represented by "red, gre, nir, blu, reg" under "vi_fun_multi.csv".
To calculate the vegetation index of hyperspectral images, "vi_fun_hyper.csv" will be represented by "R+ band millimeter reflectivity", such as "R700" for 700 mm band.

For the formula input in "vi_fun_***.csv" file, the operation symbols must be written in detail, such as "+,-,*,/,sqrt", etc.
